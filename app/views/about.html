  <h3>About Destiny Item Manager (DIM)</h3>
  <h4>Version 3.1.2</h4>
  <p>
    DIM is built upon the same services used by Bungie.net and the Destiny Companion App. DIM can access the items within your Guardians inventory and the Vault for both PlayStation and Xbox, if you have played on either platforms.

  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <dt>How does DIM get access to my Destiny data?</dt>
      <dd>Any chrome extension can ask for the data a website stores on your computer. When you log into Bungie.net, you are given a token that is based on your username and password. You use this token to communicate with Bungie securely. The token is more secure than sending your username and password with each request to Bungie's server. DIM uses this token to communicate with Bungie on your behalf.</dd>
      <dt>How can I log out of DIM?</dt>
      <dd>If you were to log out of Bungie.net in Chrome, the token that we use is invalidated, and we cannot communicate with Bunige again until you log back into Bungie.net.</dd>
      <dt>I lost my item using your tool!</dt>
      <dd>More than likely a transfer failed, leaving your item in the vault or on another character. You could search for the item. If that doesn't turn it up, refresh the app by pressing F5. Check <a href="http://bungie.net" target="_blank">Bungie.net</a> to see if your item still exists.</dd>
      <dt>Hey, DIM duplicated my Gjallarhorn!</dt>
      <dd>No, we didn't. Promise.</dd>
